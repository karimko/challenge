# Skills Challenge

Remember to use any resource you would like including StackOverflow, MSDN, Mozilla DN etc. But be prepared to answer why and how some of your solutions work!

.NET/C#

1) Add a new Field to the "fields.json" file with name "Age", type "integer" and visible "true".

2) Extend the "fields.json" to have a property called "order" and give it a value from 1-3 for each field

3) Add a property "Field.cs" to read a value for order and display the line on the console as such: "1) example = example" using order for the first part

4) Bonus: Sort fields using a lambda expressions so that the order is in reverse of the order in #3.

5) Bonus 2: change the "visible" field in "fields.json" to false for the second field. Filter out that field so it doesn't display in the console (hint: use functions for filtering eg. Linq/System.Linq)

Html/Javascript

In the sample html file "Skills.Challenge.Part.2.html" follow these instructions:

1) in the afterLoad function instead of the "alert" message change it so the text box's border colour turns red (#f00)

2) Instead of the regular expression for digits (/d/g) change it so the regular expression allows digits but does not allow the following characters !%^$\/

3) Bonus: add a new input control with 'id' as age. Make it so that the user can only select from a range of 21-35

4) Bonus: Re-write the whole page using jQuery or any framework of your choosing (functionality must be the same)
